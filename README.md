# Joke Generator Chat

## Introduction

The Joke Generator Chat allows you to interact with a few of our Joke Bots. Just send a message to one of our bots and they will respond with one of their favorite jokes.

## Start Up The Server

All of the messaging data is stored in the db.json file. Do not delete the routes.json document as there are additional configurations in that document.

Run `json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json` to start the server

## Open the Webpage

Once the server is running, open the index.html file in the browser (open index.html on Mac) and enjoy! You'll be able to interact with our joke bots!
